Deleting entries works as normal. Server entries are marked with an asterisk (*)
after their Province. 

You must have 9 or less server-side Travel Journal entries to add custom

This version was forked from the original module. I just changed a few bytes so that it works again. Please show your gratitude to the author "PatrickSantoZZ".
